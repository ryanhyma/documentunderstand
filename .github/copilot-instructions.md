# Copilot / AI agent instructions — documentunderstand

Purpose: help AI coding agents be immediately productive in this repo.

- Repo status: currently no top-level source files or project manifests
  (no `README.md`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.). If you see
  a different repo state locally, prefer real files over this template.

Primary workflow for an AI agent
- 1) Repo reconnaissance: look for these files (stop on first match):
  - `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock` (Node)
  - `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py` (Python)
  - `go.mod` (Go)
  - `Cargo.toml` (Rust)
  - `Gemfile` (Ruby)
  - `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/*` (CI), `README.md`
  If none are present, report that the repo appears empty and propose a
  minimal scaffold (README + simple language manifest + CI) before making
  large changes.

- 2) Identify language and run minimal discovery commands:
  - Node: `npm --version` then `npm ci` then `npm test` if `package.json` exists.
  - Python: create venv, `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -e .`, then `pytest -q`.
  - Go: `go version` then `go test ./...`.
  - Rust: `cargo test`.
  For unknown languages, list files and ask the user before running installs.

- 3) Read CI and scripts: open `.github/workflows`, `ci/`, and `scripts/` to
  find canonical build and test commands. Use those rather than guessed
  commands.

Project-specific conventions (how to behave here)
- This repo currently has no discoverable conventions. When you find
  `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING`, or existing `*.md` docs, use them as the
  source of truth for branch naming, test commands, and code style.
- When adding new files, place code under a `src/` or language-native root
  (e.g., `pkg/` or top-level Go packages). Keep tests adjacent to code
  (e.g., `tests/` or `__tests__` for Node/Python idioms).

How to propose changes
- Make small, self-contained PRs. Each change should include:
  - A short `README.md` update explaining the change.
  - One or more tests that validate behavior.
  - A clear commit message and PR description describing the intent.

What to do if the repository is empty
- Ask the user whether they want a minimal scaffold. If yes, propose one
  of the following based on language preference:
  - Node: `package.json` with `scripts.test` + GitHub Action for Node.
  - Python: `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` and a `pytest` GitHub Action.
  - Generic: `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and a single GitHub workflow that
    checks out code and runs a language-appropriate `test` command.

Examples (patterns to look for and reuse)
- If you find `Makefile` with a `test` target: run `make test` and reuse
  the same target in CI/workflow edits.
- If you find `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs `npm run build`, use
  `npm run build` as the authoritative build command (do not replace it
  unless you confirm intent with the repo owner).

Safety and limits for the agent
- Do not push large scaffolds or refactors without user confirmation.
- If unsure about running package-manager commands, ask before network
  installs. Provide a non-network alternative (static analysis) if asked.

Merge guidance
- If an existing `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, preserve any
  project-specific rules. Only add missing discovery steps, CI commands,
  or examples you verified. Flag conflicts for human review.

If anything here is unclear or you want this tailored to a particular
language or workflow, tell me which language and CI you prefer and I will
update this file.
